- **Bias and Discrimination**: AI algorithms can perpetuate biases and discrimination  if they are trained on biased data. This  can lead to unfair or inaccurate assessments and recommendations, which  can undermine trust in AI-powered tools and harm individuals seeking religious healing.

- **Loss of Human Connection**: Over-reliance on AI could potentially lead to a loss of human connection and empathy in religious healing. It is  important to strike a balance between the use of AI and the personal touch of religious healers, ensuring  that technology complements rather than replaces human interaction.
